# How To Contribute
## 1) What We Prioritize
Your PR is more likely to get accepted if it includes agnostic support of new open-source tools. We would like to create a hub of seamless, agnostic and fast evaluation of different Kubernetes security software. This will tremendously help organizations and individuals asses and secure their k8s resources. Of-course, we would also welcome and prioritize support of different Cloud Service Providers. Your changes must integrate with [index.html]() and export web-based dashboards to maintain an easy and coherent access. 

## 2) Discuss First, Implement Later
We are looking to engage with contributors. Please share your suggestions before you start writing any code. This will foster a healthy and fun community, and raise your chances of meeting master. Let us and the other contributors know your plans, so we could share our feedback.  

## 3) Basic Guidelines
1. Please add the associated Discussions link in the PR description.
2. Please include a comment with the results before and after your change. **IMPORTANT:** since this project (at this moment) doesn't implement testings or CI/CD validations, we ask for a demonstration of a successful end-2-end testing, which showcases code maturity and stability. This can be made through a video or footage.   
3. Please update the docs according to the your new changes in code or user experience.

## 4) Conventions
